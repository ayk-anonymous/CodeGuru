# CodeGuru
An AI tool that predicts the time complexity of code images and snippets.
CodeGuru uses Machine Learning (ML) and Natural Language Processing (NLP) algorithms to measure the running time of code blocks in Big O notation to detect areas with high levels of complexity such as long methods or functions, nested logic, or other complexity indicators. CodeGuru intends to provide developers with a clear objective way to assess code complexity. The system serves as an educational tool for less experienced developers by identifying whether a certain code is considered complex. The Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing models used are EfficientNetB0 and CodeBERT. Deployed in a responsive website for developers, students, and beginners.
